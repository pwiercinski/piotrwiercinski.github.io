Hello World!
======
Welcome to my blog! My name is Piotr and I solve problems using Maths and computers. <br><br>
This aim of this blog is to help systematise my learning as well as motivate me to do it, so I can boast about it here. <br>
Hopefully in the meantime I can also leave something others might find useful.
